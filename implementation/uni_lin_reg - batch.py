'''
	A first stab at univariate linear regression using batch vectors. Code inspired by the coursera course, machine learning with Andrew Ng. 
	This program takes a wind speed and outputs a projected pollution value. The linear model makes assumptions about the normality of the 
	data, which may be violated, because we have outliers. For the given data set, we model the effect of wind speed on pollution
	value as something like y = -7.34x + 135.93. Not the best model, of course, since we are only evaluating pollution based on one predictor.
	Also, not clear that the relationship between pollution and wind speed is strictly linear
